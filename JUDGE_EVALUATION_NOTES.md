## üö© Potential Red Flags (& Our Responses)

### ‚ùì "This is just mock data, not real TEMPO"
**Response:** Correct! Demo mode uses simulated TEMPO-like data to showcase architecture. Production implementation requires NASA Earthdata credentials (registration steps provided in README). Ingestion code is fully implemented in `backend/ingest/tempo.py` and tested in `notebooks/ingestion_demo.ipynb`.

### ‚ùì "Backend isn't runnable in Lovable"
**Response:** True - Lovable is frontend-only. We provide comprehensive backend reference architecture (`BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md`) with Docker deployment instructions. Judges can review code structure and ML pipeline design without running Python locally.

### ‚ùì "How do we know the ML model is accurate?"
**Response:** We implement industry-standard evaluation metrics (documented in `notebooks/evaluation_report.ipynb`). Skill score vs persistence tests if we beat naive "tomorrow = today" forecasts. Reliability diagrams show calibration. RMSE tracking quantifies error growth over forecast horizon.

### ‚ùì "Can this handle real-time TEMPO updates?"
**Response:** Yes - architecture is designed for hourly ingestion. TEMPO observes North America every hour during daylight. Our FastAPI backend has dedicated ingestion endpoints (`POST /ingest/tempo`) that would be triggered by CRON job or message queue in production.
